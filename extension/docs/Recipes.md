### Using in a typescript project

The recommended way is to use [`redux-devtools-extension` npm package](/README.md#13-use-redux-devtools-extension-package-from-npm), which contains all typescript definitions. Or you can just use `window as any`:

```js
const store = createStore(
  rootReducer,
  initialState,
  (window as any).__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__ &&
    (window as any).__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__()
);
```

Note that you many need to set `no-any` to false in your `tslint.json` file.

Alternatively you can use typeguard in order to avoid
casting to any.

```typescript
import { createStore, StoreEnhancer } from 'redux';

// ...

type WindowWithDevTools = Window & {
  __REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__: () => StoreEnhancer<unknown, {}>;
};

const isReduxDevtoolsExtenstionExist = (
  arg: Window | WindowWithDevTools
): arg is WindowWithDevTools => {
  return '__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__' in arg;
};

// ...

const store = createStore(
  rootReducer,
  initialState,
  isReduxDevtoolsExtenstionExist(window)
    ? window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__()
    : undefined
);
```

### Export from browser console or from application

```js
store.liftedStore.getState();
```

The extension is not sharing `store` object, so you should take care of that.

### Applying multiple times with different sets of options

We're [not allowing that from instrumentation part](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-instrument/blob/master/src/instrument.js#L676), because that would re-dispatch every app action in case we'd have many liftedStores, but there's [a helper for logging only](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension/blob/master/npm-package/logOnly.js), which can be used it like so:

```js
import { createStore, compose } from 'redux';
import { devToolsEnhancer } from 'redux-devtools-extension/logOnly';

const store = createStore(
  reducer,
  /* preloadedState, */ compose(
    devToolsEnhancer({
      instaceID: 1,
      name: 'Denylisted',
      actionsDenylist: '...',
    }),
    devToolsEnhancer({
      instaceID: 2,
      name: 'Allowlisted',
      actionsAllowlist: '...',
    })
  )
);
```
